***Why is this project of interest to you?***
This project is of interest to me because I am passionate about finance and, and being in the BUCS program I am 
pursuing business in addition to computer science. I feel like this project is an opportunity for me to start to 
combine these two interests by creating a program that integrates these two fields, even if it is only at a basic 
level.
